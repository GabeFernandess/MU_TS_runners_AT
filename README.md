# MU_TS_runners_AT
Reduced motor unit discharge rates in gastrocnemius lateralis, but not in gastrocnemius medialis or soleus, in runners with Achilles tendinopathy.

This study investigated the motor unit discharge rates in all triceps surae muscles between runners with mid-portion AT and healthy runners during an increase in isometric torque. Further we explored the variability of motor unit discharge rate for each muscle and torque steadiness during plantar flexor isometric torque.
